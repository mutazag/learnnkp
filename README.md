## dev container

The work in this workspace is done inside a dev container, this allows my to set up the python envinronment with the needed configuration without interfering with local setup, and the devcontainer definition is portbale to run on other machines.

Vscode can create docker containers as dev envinronments. To use dev containers in VSCode, run the command `Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files...`.
